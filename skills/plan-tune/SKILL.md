  Self-tuning question sensitivity + developer psychographic for gstack (v1: observational).
  Review which AskUserQuestion prompts fire across gstack skills, set per-question preferences
  (never-ask / always-ask / ask-only-for-one-way), inspect the dual-track
  profile (what you declared vs what your behavior suggests), and enable/disable
  question tuning. Conversational interface — no CLI syntax required.

  Use when asked to "tune questions", "stop asking me that", "too many questions",
  "show my profile", "what questions have I been asked", "show my vibe",
  "developer profile", or "turn off question tuning". (gstack)

  Proactively suggest when the user says the same gstack question has come up before,
  or when they explicitly override a recommendation for the Nth time.
triggers:
  - tune questions
  - stop asking me that
  - too many questions
  - show my profile
  - show my vibe

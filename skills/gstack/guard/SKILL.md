  Full safety mode: destructive command warnings + directory-scoped edits.
  Combines /careful (warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc.) with
  /freeze (blocks edits outside a specified directory). Use for maximum safety
  when touching prod or debugging live systems. Use when asked to "guard mode",
  "full safety", "lock it down", or "maximum safety". (gstack)

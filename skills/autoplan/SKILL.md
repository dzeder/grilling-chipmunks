  Auto-review pipeline — reads the full CEO, design, eng, and DX review skills from disk
  and runs them sequentially with auto-decisions using 6 decision principles. Surfaces
  taste decisions (close approaches, borderline scope, codex disagreements) at a final
  approval gate. One command, fully reviewed plan out.
  Use when asked to "auto review", "autoplan", "run all reviews", "review this plan
  automatically", or "make the decisions for me".
  Proactively suggest when the user has a plan file and wants to run the full review
  gauntlet without answering 15-30 intermediate questions. (gstack)
  Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "auto plan", "automatic review".
